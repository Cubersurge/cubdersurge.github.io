<p>Built all for free, and available soon! We are currently adding on to this new experience, as a better version of our 2 previous creations, The Shadows and Into the Light.</p>

<p>This will not replace Into the Light even though the older game is outdated and discontinued. This new game is completely independent from Into the Light!</p>
